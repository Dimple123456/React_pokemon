This React project fetches PokÃ©mon data from the PokÃ©mon API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/). It retrieves details like names, images, and abilities and displays them dynamically on the screen. The app features a grid layout and can include a search or filter option for better user interaction.

This is a React + Vite project with ESLint setup for better code quality. To use it, make sure you have React and Vite installed on your PC. Clone the repo, run npm install, and start the dev server with npm run dev. ðŸš€
